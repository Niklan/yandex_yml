# Yandex YML

**Documentation**: [online](http://yandex-yml.readthedocs.io/en/8.x-1.x/), [local](/docs).

YML (Yandex Market Language) â€” is XML file with products for Yandex.Market. Not to be confused with YAML files, which also have **.yml** extension.

This module provide API **for developers** to generate product yml file. Module doesn't contain any administrative interface.

## Drupal 7

This module will not be ported to Drupal 7 because of it's architecture. Module is build on OOP, services and annotations (some dependencies from doctrine from Drupal 8 core). I recommend don't waste your time and use already working module for it: [Yandex Market YML Generator API](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/xandeadx/2498393).
