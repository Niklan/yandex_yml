# Yandex YML

YML (Yandex Market Language) — is XML file with products for Yandex.Market. Not to be confused with YAML files, which also have **.yml** extension.

This module provide API **for developers** to generate product yml file. Module doesn't contain any administrative interface.

[Official validator](https://webmaster.yandex.ru/tools/xml-validator/) — don't forget to change tab to Market.

## Drupal 7

This module will not be ported to Drupal 7 because of it's architecture. Module is build on OOP, services and annotations (some dependencies from doctrine from Drupal 8 core). I recommend don't waste your time and use already working module for it: [Yandex Market YML Generator API](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/xandeadx/2498393).
